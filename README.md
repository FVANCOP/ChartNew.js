ChartNew.js
===========


Simple HTML5 Charts using the canvas element




For my personal use, I had to integrate lot of changes into Chart.js (https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js). 

So, I have re-worked Chart.js. Most of the changes are associated to requests in "GitHub" issues of Chart.js.

Chart.js has been completely rewritten since ChartNew.js has been developed; Both code are now completely different. Most of the functionalities inserted in the new version of Chart.js are also available in ChartNew.js

June 2014 - [Ole Kr√∂ger](http://github.com/Wikunia) is now a co-developer of the project. More ideas, more people to give support. Welcome to him. 



New Charts integrated in this version compared to Chart.js

* HorizontalBar
* HorizontalStackedBar
* [Line,Bar with logarithmic y-Axis](../../wiki/100_110_Scale)
* [BarLine (bar chart with an integrated line chart)](../../wiki/070_020_Bar#barline)

This version is down-compatible (on PC) with the version of Chart.js available on 13 January 2014.

Hope it will be useful for some of you ! Perhaps a start for a new community development... Why not ?

# Graph Generator

Using ChartNew.js, Omar Sedki has developed a graph generator. Though a user friendly interface, you can produce a graph and save it.
